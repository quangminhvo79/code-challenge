# Frontend Code Challenge Repository

This repository was created as part of my application for a **Frontend Developer** position.

It contains three separate exercises focusing on problem-solving, UI/UX implementation, and code quality improvement.

Implement different approaches to calculate the sum of the first _n_ natural numbers, including:
- Mathematical formula
- Iterative method
- Recursive function
